# Brain Tumor Patient Survival Prediction
This program predicts brain tumor patient survival given 3D MRI volumes. The goal was to test three different model approaches and analyze which model performed the best on the given dataset. The three model approahces I chose were:  
## Global Regression  
This model was the least accurate model, scoring a median absolute error of 0.064.  
## Standard Autoencoder  
This model scored in the middle of the pack, with a median absolute error of 0.052.  
## Fully-Convolutional Network  
This model performed the best of the three, with a median absolute error of 0.05.
